                  <p>
                    If you have ever asked these questions, we encourage you to
                    sign up for the Guardian Breakout Workshop. OEM and Tier 1
                    Suppliers that pre-register and attend the Guardian Breakout
                    will receive a free pack of 10 GPS/WiFi/Cell trackers with
                    service and platform access included for one year.

                    No dock door scanners, no handheld readers, and only a small
                    percentage of individual rack and container fleets need to
                    be tracked. GPS and WiFi location data is communicated over
                    cell networks to tell you where your rack and container
                    problems are happening anywhere in North America.

                    Engage Guardianâ€™s on-site auditing and recovery services, or
                    operate the specialized Guardian tracking system internally.
                    We will demonstrate how probability based GPS/WiFi/Cell
                    tracking works, common pathways of rack and container loss
                    you can expect to see, and how you can start tackling your
                    largest supply chain issues across the map.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We will also speak to the benefits and limitations of adding
                    BLE into the GPS/WiFi/Cell tracking, how logistics teams can
                    monitor carriers by tracking racks and containers, our
                    supply chain metrics dashboard, and more.
